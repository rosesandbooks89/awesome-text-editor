## User Story

AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a text editor web application
* WHEN I open my application in my editor
* THEN I should see a client server folder structure
* WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
* THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
* WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
* THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
* WHEN I run my webpack plugins
* THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
* WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
* THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
* WHEN I open the text editor
* THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
* WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
* THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
* WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
* THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
* WHEN I click on the Install button
* THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
* WHEN I load my web application
* THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
* WHEN I register a service worker
* THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
* WHEN I deploy to Heroku
* THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application

## Struggles and Sources
I struggled a bit with this project. I had a hard time getting the application to load with no consol errors. I had worked with a classmate that had used a plugin called polyfill. I tried to use that plug in but it caused errors with my workbox. I didn't realize that was an issue but after removing it the app works as it should
